<h1><strong>Role of hosting platforms in web development</strong></h1>

<p>Hosting and platforms play a vital role in modern software development by ensuring applications are both 
    accessible and scalable. Hosting provides the infrastructure servers, storage, and network connectivity that allows web applications to be available online, while platforms such as AWS, Azure, 
    and Google Cloud go further by offering integrated services like databases, AI tools, and deployment pipelines. Together, 
    they reduce the burden on developers by handling complex infrastructure management, enabling faster innovation, global reach, and cost efficiency through models.</p>

<h2><strong>Static vs dyamic hosting events</strong></h2>
<p> Static hosting environments deliver pre-built files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly to users, making them ideal for simple websites like portfolios or documentation because they are fast, secure, and easy to set up. 
    However, they cannot handle server-side logic, databases, or user authentication.</p>

<h3><strong>Limitations of GitHub Pages in web management</strong></h3>
<p>Static hosting environments provide users with pre-built files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making them fast, secure, and ideal for simple websites like portfolios or documentation. 
    They deliver the same content to every visitor without server-side processing, which limits their ability to handle features like databases or user authentication. Dynamic hosting environments, in contrast, generate content on the server in response to user requests, allowing for personalized experiences, interactive applications, and complex systems such as e-commerce platforms or social networks.</p>

<h4><strong>When to move from static hosting to server-based hosting</strong></h4>
<p>You should consider moving from static hosting to server-based hosting when your project requires features that go 
    beyond delivering simple pre-built files. Static hosting is ideal for basic sites like portfolios or documentation, but it becomes limiting once you need dynamic functionality such as user authentication, database integration, personalized content, or real-time interactions.</p>
